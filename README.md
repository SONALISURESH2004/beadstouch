BeadsTouch is an innovative abacus learning platform developed using React.js, where I integrated machine learning algorithms for real-time finger gesture recognition using TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe. It features interactive quizzes and a visual abacus experience to aid children's learning. The app's data is securely stored and managed using Firebase (Firestore and Authentication). I focused mainly on frontend development, gaining hands-on experience with React components, routing, and state management. Throughout the project, I also explored the basics of TensorFlow, MediaPipe hand tracking, and Firebase integration, enhancing both my technical skills and problem-solving capabilities. This project is a strong showcase of how emerging technologies can be used in educational tools.
